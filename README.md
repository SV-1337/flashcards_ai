This is a project for Headstarter Fellowship Week 3. It uses a Gemini AI API, Stripe API for payment processing, and Clerk for Identity Access Management, to make a simple SaaS that allows users to make their flashcards using AI. All payment is set up to be in prototype mode, and the website does not require payments. Live Link: flashcards-ai-self.vercel.app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
